    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Meet peach cobbler: in cookie form! This thumbprint-style cookie is filled with warm-spiced peach filling, just
        like peach cobbler. To prevent the cookies from getting too soft, keep the extras stored in the refrigerator.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cups diced, pitted, peeled fresh peaches</li>
        <li>1/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For filling: Place peaches, brown sugar, butter, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt to a small saucepan
            over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until mixture is boiling and sugar is dissolved, about 5
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir lemon juice and cornstarch together in a small bowl until thoroughly combined; pour into the peaches
            and stir to thoroughly incorporate. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.
            Pour mixture into a heatproof container and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, about 1 hour, or up to 2
            days.</li>
        <li>For cookie dough: Beat butter, brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together with an
            electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add in egg, vanilla, and almond extract and beat for
            1 minute more. Add in flour, baking powder, and baking soda and mix on low speed until mixture comes
            together in a stiff dough.</li>
    </ol>
