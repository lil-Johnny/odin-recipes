    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These slow cooker ribs are the best — they turn out perfect every time! They cook in a crockpot until tender,
        then are covered with barbeque sauce and finished in the oven for fall-apart ribs. Perfect for during the week
        as the slow cooker does most of the work!</p>

        <li>3 pounds baby back ribs, trimmed</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper, to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season ribs with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/2 cup water into the slow cooker, then add ribs. Scatter onion and garlic over top. Cover and cook on
